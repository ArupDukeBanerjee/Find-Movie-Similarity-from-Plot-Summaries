# Find-Movie-Similarity-from-Plot-Summaries
In this Project, we will use NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia.

## Project Tasks

1. Import and observe dataset
2. Combine Wikipedia and IMDb plot summaries
3. Tokenization
4. Stemming
5. Club together Tokenize & Stem
6. Create TfidfVectorizer
7. Fit transform TfidfVectorizer
8. Import KMeans and create clusters
9. Calculate similarity distance
10. Import Matplotlib, Linkage, and Dendrograms
11. Create merging and plot dendrogram
12. Which movies are most similar?
